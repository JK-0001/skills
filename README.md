# Solopreneur Skills Library
A collection of 40 structured playbooks and frameworks for solopreneurs, covering everything from validating your first idea to scaling beyond yourself.

Each skill is a self-contained playbook with step-by-step frameworks, decision trees, templates, real examples, and common mistakes. Designed to work both as reference docs and as Claude AI skills.

## How to Use with Claude

These skills work as context files for Claude. Drop a `SKILL.md` into your Claude skills folder and Claude will use the playbook when you ask about that topic.

**Setup:**
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Copy the skill folders you want into your Claude skills directory
3. Claude will automatically reference the playbook when you ask relevant questions

**Trigger phrases** are listed in each skill's frontmatter, these are the phrases that tell Claude to use that skill. For example, asking *"help me validate my idea"* will trigger the `idea-validation` skill.
